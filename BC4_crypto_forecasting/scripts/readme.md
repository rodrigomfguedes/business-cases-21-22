# Work Logs

 
## Work Log 1 

- Loaded the excel files
- Merged them into a single DF
- Split the information for every cryptocurrency into it's own dataframe (10 in total, df_ADA, df_ATOM...) 
- Each DF contains the specific market_metrics for every crypto ('ADJCLOSE', 'CLOSE', 'HIGH', 'LOW', 'OPEN', 'VOLUME')
